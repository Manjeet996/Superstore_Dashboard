# Superstore Dashboard - Tableau Project
#### This repository contains my first practice Tableau dashboard developed using the Sample Superstore dataset. The purpose of this project was to enhance my skills in data visualization and dashboard creation using Tableau. This interactive dashboard offers an insightful analysis of sales, profit, and order metrics across different regions and years.

## Project Overview
#### The Superstore Dashboard provides a dynamic and interactive view of key business metrics. It demonstrates how Tableau can be used to create comprehensive visualizations for performance analysis, allowing users to interact with the data and refine their insights through filters and metric selections.

## Dataset Overview
#### The Sample Superstore dataset contains transactional data for a fictional retail store, including sales, profit, product categories, and customer demographics. It’s widely used for educational purposes and dashboard demonstrations.

## Key Dashboard Features
#### •	Interactive Filters: Filter by Year and Region to refine the analysis.
#### •	Metric Selection: Choose between Sales, Profit, and Number of Orders (# Orders) to dynamically adjust the visualizations.
#### •	Top 5 Products: The dashboard consistently displays the top 5 products based on the selected metric.
#### •	KPI Cards: Displays key performance indicators such as Profit Margin and Return Rate.
#### •	Filter Actions: Clicking on a category in the Category chart dynamically updates the other charts and KPIs.
#### •	Company Logo Interaction: Clicking on the logo redirects users to the published dashboard on Tableau Public.
